## Hadoop Resource Integration

To use Hadoop resources under StreamX Flink-K8s runtime, such as checkpoint mounting HDFS, accessing Hive, etc.  Users need to build the relevant Flink Base Docker Image by themselves. The Image needs to contain the following contentï¼š

* Include Hadoop Lib resource, and set `HADOOP_CLASSPATH`ï¼›
* Include Hadoop Config resourceï¼Œand set `HADOOP_CONF_DIR`ï¼›
* Include  Hive Config Resource when using Hive;

<br/>

This is actually quite inconvenient ðŸ¥², we will support automatic integration of Hadoop features in subsequent releases, Plz look forward to !
